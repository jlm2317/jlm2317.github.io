I led lectures presenting new units on historical genetics theories and practical quantitative approaches for over 100 upperclassmen in animal science. Part of my responsibilities was to meet with students to provide feedback, answer questions and concerns, assist with missed classes and explain homework problems. My most important role was to review and grade honor section students assigned R programming problems, and provide lessons in syntax, better programming practices, and debugging procedures in the effort to familiarize with and encourage students to pursue future works in animal science computational research.
