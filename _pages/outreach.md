### Science Day at Dogwood Elementary School, Kearney MO  

![Teaching About DNA](../images/DogwoodOutreach.png)

#### *May 23 2023*   
I Instructed school children from Kindergarten to 5th grade with a hands-on activity where each student or a pair of students extracted DNA from strawberries. Here, I gave age appropriate information and fun facts about biology, DNA and cells. I demonstrated the extraction experiment with easy to follow explanations for what each step is for. The students used the supplies I brought and parent volunteers followed my leadership to distribute and supervise each student's experiment. Students were encouraged to consider careers related to science, and to think like a scientist when encountering everyday things like the strawberries in the experiment.
