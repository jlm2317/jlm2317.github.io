####Science Day at Dogwood Elementary School, Kearney MO  

[Teaching About DNA](images/DogwoodOutreach.png)

Instructed school children from Kindergarten to 5th grade with a hands-on activity where each student or a pair of students extracted DNA from strawberries. Gave age appropriate information and fun facts about biology, DNA and cells. Provided demonstration of the extraction experiment with easy to follow explanations for what each step is for. Brought supplies and led parent volunteers in distributing and supervising each student's experiment. Encouraged students to consider studying or careers related to science, and to think like a scientist when encountering everyday things like the strawberries in the experiment.
