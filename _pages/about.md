# **My Research** 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My ongoing research is using population genetics and comparative genomics to answer questions in evolution. I am currently utilizing whole genome data and demographic methods  to characterize the global diversity of Bovids including domestic cattle and their wild relatives. This work involves modeling patterns of migration and admixture and detecting selection, both natural and artificial and on a global scale. Both the wealth of data and significant relationship between human cultures and domestic cattle means that understanding these dynamics can answer many different questions. We also utilize modern techniques to search for polygenic selection, which will help us to better understand the mechanisms of domestication by looking for the genomic signatures more simple approaches struggle to detect.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To me, the mysteries of evolutionary history are endless and deeply fascinating, which is why I strive to look to the entirety of nature for model systems and the intersection of scientific disciples for tools and methods. We now live in the age of big data, and sophisticated computational technology, but utilizing what is available and understanding just what questions can and should be addressed given these resources is what inspires me. I have gone from previous work modeling molecular evolution across hundreds of millions of years, in an underrepresented clade, spiders, to ongoing work using ancient DNA data to explore genomic changes on the scale of a few thousand years with one of the most widely studied groups, humans. My open curiosity drives me to continue searching for ways to freshen and deepen our understanding of the natural world.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe that as scientists, it is our duty to not only understand nature, but to use our technical skills and public advocacy to contribute in the ethical management and preservation. As an evolutionary biologist, I have been contributing my specialized knowledge towards another ongoing project where through analysis of the population genetics of an endangered fish species, the Topeka Shiner, I hope to advise conservation efforts, ranging from evaluating a captive breeding program to understanding dynamics of consequences to populations found at release sites.  


# **My Background**
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am an evolutionary biologist with a passionate fascination with the natural world. My interests have driven me to pursue a career where my efforts contribute to our shared understanding and appreciation of life on earth.    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have always been interested in studying biology, but choosing a more specific discipline was a process of trial, error and self discovery. I began my higher education planning to pursue a future in biomedical engineering or clinical oncology, but quickly found myself most enamored by studying evolution. On what seems like a fateful trip into the field to collect samples for an entomology project, I found a spider which was mimicking the ants it was wandering amongst quite convincingly. This discovery brought me so much wonder, that I finally made the switch which was long coming, and set my sights on graduate school instead of medical school.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being enraptured by the diversity and adaptability of life, I  became involved in undergraduate research and got some hands-on wet lab experience for a genetic barcoding project. Here I learned the fundamentals of benchwork, but more significantly, the importance of thoughtful experimental design.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I joined a computational lab during my masters program and entered into a whole new world: studying evolution from the molecular viewpoint. It was here that I began to grasp the type of data and algorithmic techniques involved in modern studies of genomics, and just how complex natural selection can be from different paradigms.  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I next moved onto studying population genetics during my PhD program, looking at answering more specific questions in evolution, such as how anthropogenic forces shaped populations of domesticated species on a global scale. Working with an agriculturally relevant species gave me the opportunity to truly see the scale of data used by industries, governments, and international consortiums.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each stage in my research and educational journey has instilled me with new skills, new understandings, and new ways of thinking. A major factor in this has been my desire to be a well rounded scientist with an interdisciplinary mindset.
