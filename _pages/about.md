# **My Research** 
I am currently studying cattle evolution.

# **My Background**
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am an evolutionary biologist with a passionate fascination with the natural world. 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have always been interested in studying biology, but choosing a more specific discipline was a process of trial, error and self discovery. I began my higher education planning to pursue a future in biomedical engineering or clinical oncology, but quickly found myself most enamored by studying evolution. On what seems like a fateful trip into the field to collect samples for an entomology project, I found a spider which was mimicking the ants it was wandering amongst quite convincingly. This discovery brought me so much wonder, that I finally made the switch which was long coming, and set my sights on graduate school instead of medical school. 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being enraptured by the diversity and adaptability of life, I  became involved in undergraduate research and got some hands-on wet lab experience for a genetic barcoding project. Here I learned the fundamentals of benchwork, but more significantly, the importance of thoughtful experimental design.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I joined a computational lab during my masters program and entered into a whole new world: studying evolution from the molecular viewpoint. It was here that I began to grasp the type of data and algorithmic techniques involved in modern studies of genomics, and just how complex natural selection can be from different paradigms.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I next moved onto studying population genetics during my PhD program, looking at answering more specific questions in evolution, such as how anthropogenic forces shaped populations of domesticated species on a global scale. Working with an agriculturally relevant species gave me the opportunity to truly see the scale of data used by industries, governments, and international consortiums. 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each stage in my research and educational journey has instilled me with new skills, new understandings, and new ways of thinking. A major factor in this has been my desire to be a well rounded scientist with an interdisciplinary mindset. 


# **About Me**
I am a passionate reader of classic literature.
